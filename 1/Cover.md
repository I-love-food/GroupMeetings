1. Backgrounds: this part is gonna cover plenty of stuff (time spent: 30~40 min)
2. Things about this paper (time spent: 30~40 min)

**What is important is that:**

* I need to know everything I put on my slides
* I need to know how this paper is related to my research direction

Slides count: ~ 20

Overall presentation style: Top-down

Detail:

Backgrounds:
1. Implicit neural representation (NeRF, instant-NGP, neural radiosity, 隐式场景表达) (泛泛而谈，把基本方法说一下)
2. Multiresolution hash grid for features (托马斯穆勒论文) (可能要细说) 👌
3. Bounding Volume Hierarchy -> 基本BVH，SAH (细说)
4. Ray tracing, Path tracing, Realistic rendering, Photorealistic rendering, Physically based rendering (PBR) (他们的区分，细说PBR)
5. Level of detail (简单说一下, 举例unreal)
6. Prefiltering (Mipmap)
7. BRDF, BSDF

Vocabulary:
* strict: 严格的, PBR is a rendering tech that strictly follow the energy conversion rule.
* intuitive: 直观的, let's show a intuitive comparison between simplest ray tracing and path tracing
* step-by-step: 一步一步的, there is a step-by-step tutorial on this topic
